                    It is regarded as the birthplace of mothers. The mother leaves her birthplace on the first day of the festivities 
                    and enters the Vuyyuru Ammavari Temple the next.</p><br><br><br>

                    On the first day, it is expected that about one lakh devotees will flock to Thiru Gandadeepa to pay homage to the plants.
                     According to Anavaiti, the Vuyyuru police will kick off the festivities on the first day by displaying yellow saffron and
                     new clothing. Thousands of women and devotees planted lanterns when Veeramma’s mother left Mettin on the first day.
                     The goddess follows her around until she reaches the Vuyyuru Veeramma Talli Temple and lights the lamp.

                      The Sidibandi ritual, celebrated on the 11th day, is the most important of all rituals.
                    As part of it, the most eligible Dalit bachelor would be made to do circumambulate the temple.
                     The thousands of devotees throw bananas at the youth, seated in a basket. 
                    The whole town will be abuzz with playing kolatam with musicians playing their bands.
                     According to the folklore, Veerammatalli’s birth name is Veerasivamma. 
                    She was born to Boddu Parasuramayya and Parvatamma of Peda Kadiyam in Eluru taluk of West Godavari district. 
                    She married Chintayya of Vuyyuru when she was eight-years-old.

                     Upon attaining puberty she was sent to her in-laws place to have a family life.
                     But, the village Karanam Subbayya set his sight on her. 
                    He along with his brother-in-law hatched a conspiracy to kill Chintayya and his brother as his plans to make her succumb 
                    to his desire proved futile. He along with his brother-in-law poisoned Chintayya to death when Chintayya and his brother
                     went to Mustabada near Gannavaram to graze sheep. Pained at her husband’s death, she cursed Subbayya and committed Sati.
                     The then Zamindar of Vuyyur and representative of Nawab Zinna Saheb got a temple built for her. 
                    The festival is celebrated since then annually.
