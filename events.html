        As it is unfamiliar festival for everyone, many people do not know on how to celebrate it too. 
        The festival starts 15 days before shivaratri which is also a holy festival in surrounding area.
         It starts on full moon i.e., pournami. All the arrangements of this festival were done by the 
         goddess clan. The veeramma talli travels from her in-law’s house to her mother’s house. These 15
          days are celebrating on her mother’s house. On day 1, people from different areas come to see 
          this prestigious event and people who worshiped her will give tirugu deepam and gana deepam. 
          Usually, the goddess travels everywhere in vuyyuru and goes to every house to give her 
          blessings. On her enshrine, people who travel along with goddess will give tirugu deepam and 
          who just travel some distance and just show the light to goddess is called gana deepam.

          Normally, it starts according to the muhurtam given by the priests. In olden days the Raja 
          Jinnah sahib, who was the origin of this festival, has to give saree for starting of this 
          festival. In nowadays, the sare has to be given by the local police. After collecting the 
          sare, people of her clan will decorate her. And she will start the procession in palanquin. 
          Firstly, she will go to Panchayati to receive sare. And then she starts the main procession
           and receives sares from every house. It takes 2 days to complete the procession but she will 
           not stop in shivalayam because lord Shiva did not help her when she asked him to help. In 
           second day, during evening she will swing and goes into temple. Right from that day, people 
           come to worship her and offer her gifts(kanukalu). The 11th day is called as Sidi bandi. 
           People who helped her on her hard days i.e., their clan people will cut down the tree to make
            the vehicle for travelling i.e., bandi before the starting of the festival. And she will 
            tell to the people in their dreams on which tress had to be cut. In their clan, the 
            unmarried man will sit on sidi bandi and people starting throwing banana, flowers onto him.
             Remaining days are normally celebrated. On the 15th day, she will start from her mother’s 
             house. After her start from her mother’s house, she will go to a place called Iluru , which
              is famous for Shivaratri, and will have a bath. From that day the shivaratri will start on 
              that place. And she will go around another time and goes into her in law’s house.

                   <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium;">Near the Vuyyuru Veeramma Talli Temple, there is another shrine dedicated to the goddess. 
                    It is regarded as the birthplace of mothers. The mother leaves her birthplace on the first day of the festivities 
                    and enters the Vuyyuru Ammavari Temple the next.
                    
                    On the first day, it is expected that about one lakh devotees will flock to Thiru Gandadeepa to pay homage to the plants.
                     According to Anavaiti, the Vuyyuru police will kick off the festivities on the first day by displaying yellow saffron and
                     new clothing. Thousands of women and devotees planted lanterns when Veeramma’s mother left Mettin on the first day.
                     The goddess follows her around until she reaches the Vuyyuru Veeramma Talli Temple and lights the lamp.
                    
                    The cradle festival is held in grand style at Vuyyuru Koodali on the evening of the second day of the festival.
                    
                    
                    The 15-day Local Goddess festival of Veerammathalli will commence here from Thursday. 
                    Annually, the festival is celebrated on Bheeshma Ekadasi in the auspicious Telugu month of Magham.
                     Lakhs will throng the place to participate in the festival and fulfill their vows to the Goddess.
                     When the Goddess sets out at 8.30 pm on Thursday from her in-laws’ house, 
                    fasting women in thousands welcome the Goddess with lamps.
                    
                    The next day she will enter the temple
                     On the last day of the festival, 
                    she comes out of the temple and takes bath in River Krishna at Thotavalluru and return to her in-laws’ place.
                     As tradition would have it,
                     the police department would offer turmeric, 
                    vermillion and new clothes to the deity prior to the deity setting out of her in-laws place.
                    
                    
                      The Sidibandi ritual, celebrated on the 11th day, is the most important of all rituals.
                    As part of it, the most eligible Dalit bachelor would be made to do circumambulate the temple.
                     The thousands of devotees throw bananas at the youth, seated in a basket. 
                    The whole town will be abuzz with playing kolatam with musicians playing their bands.
                     According to the folklore, Veerammatalli’s birth name is Veerasivamma. 
                    She was born to Boddu Parasuramayya and Parvatamma of Peda Kadiyam in Eluru taluk of West Godavari district. 
                    She married Chintayya of Vuyyuru when she was eight-years-old.
                     Upon attaining puberty she was sent to her in-laws place to have a family life.
                     But, the village Karanam Subbayya set his sight on her. 
                    He along with his brother-in-law hatched a conspiracy to kill Chintayya and his brother as his plans to make her succumb 
                    to his desire proved futile. He along with his brother-in-law poisoned Chintayya to death when Chintayya and his brother
                     went to Mustabada near Gannavaram to graze sheep. Pained at her husband’s death, she cursed Subbayya and committed Sati.
                     The then Zamindar of Vuyyur and representative of Nawab Zinna Saheb got a temple built for her. 
                    The festival is celebrated since then annually.
